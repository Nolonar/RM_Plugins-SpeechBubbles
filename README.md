# N_SpeechBubbles
Renders speech bubbles above targets.

![Screenshot TitleMap][screenshot]

You can display speech bubbles using:
- notetags to automatically display speech bubbles when the player gets close enough.
- plugin commands.
  - Choose which event spawns a speech bubble: by ID, by variable value, "this event", or even "player".
  - Choose how long the bubble remains visible. By default, bubbles will automatically set their duration depending on the number of visible characters they display.
  - Choose whether the event should wait until the current speech bubble has disappeared, or whether it should just continue without waiting.
